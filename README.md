The objective of this project is to create a device capable of monitoring power consumption from a plug outlet, with the ability to switch off when a predefined threshold is reached. This project aims to achieve three main objectives: designing and developing a Smart Plug to accurately measure voltage and current consumption of a single-phase load, implementing a micro-controller as a base-station for data communication with the Smart Plug, and demonstrating the base stationâ€™s control over the Smart Plug for monitoring and regulating power consumption. Additionally, the project involves deploying a cloud-based user interface for clients to access and monitor power consumption of connected loads via the Smart Plug device.
